1. Requirements
===============

Make sure you have installed the JDK 1.5 or higher.
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.jsp
Make sure you have installed MySQL 4.0 or higher.
http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/
Make sure you have installed the Java MySQL connector 3.0 or higher.
(As of writing V3.1 is bugged and will cause an excess memory use,
and V3.2 was alpha, so we suggest to use 3.0)
http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/3.0.html



2. Preparations
===============

 2.1 MySQL
 =========
 create the correct database/user and import the borknet.sql file.
 after this, run the CreateAccount program, which will create the
 Services Admin account.

 2.2 PHP
 =======
 since N uses md5 hashes of passwords in it's db, it is not possible to
 retrieve user passwords. Because of this, we have created a possibility to
 reset user passwords. When a user issues the requestpassword command, a
 mail gets sent to the e-mail belonging to that auth account. In this e-mail
 is a link, which, when clicked, will reset the user's password.
 for this to work, you'll need to put up the requestpassword.php and
 /incs/bork_connect.php files on your networks site, and add your networks
 main address to the config. The links will then look something like
 http://www.yournet.org/requestpassword.php?user=Username&code=dVrt6g .



3. Configuration
================

edit bot.conf.

edit /core/modules/botname/botname.conf for each of the modules.



4. Running
==========

./services
(To turn off debugging/logging remove the flag from the startupline)

Makes sure you obey the directory structure, that means the Start.class file
should be in a directory called borknet_services, with all other dirs below.



5. Closing stuff
================
