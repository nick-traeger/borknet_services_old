Urgent:
Fix/Find/Confirm bug in N not deleting a channel that got closed on net resync? --> We need a second server for that :(
check compatibility with higher mysql connector
check db cleanup error --> prolly a daylight savings bug? although unix timestamps should prevent that...
add automated message to Q that informs users when an admin uses changepass, giving them their new password.

Upgrades:
Use hashmaps to store module commands instead of arraylists.
Cleanup mysql queries & indexes to imporve speed (maybe even use a partial memory system?).
Use one central dbcore, with subclasses for bot specific db actions.
