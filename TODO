MILESTONE 2.0 STUFF

(Core) Close resultset and preparedstatements --> http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=5022
(Core) Include mysqlConnector J in the release instead of a seperate install (just add the jar to the classpath), 
       while doing this, Maybe make an installer, it could check out the svn and configure some basic bot stuff, 
       then start createaccount, this would also mean the user can decide where to install it without knowing
       anything about java.
(Core) Userchans should hold voice and op status, not just op. (is this realy needed?)
(Core) There's an issue with removing servers on rehash on some networks, apperantly.
(Core) Juped servers don't get deleted.
(Core) Userchans in memory.
(Q) Improve limit function (hold current channel modes?).
(Q) Add some nifty new features/flags as per QuakeNet.
(P) Do some testing.
(G) Connect4 allows players to play when it's not their turn.
(Tutor) Catch filenotfounds.

Upgrades:
- Store more information about modes, limits, etc. Parse info to check if it is set or not before bursting to reduce traffic.
- Rename commands to a better name (ungline->glinedel, changechanlev, etc)
- Give commands a level requirement which is checked before the command is executed (A simple variable will do).
- What to do with chanfix? Let it reset on service restarts? Load & save? It's needed for R. --> Load & save at startup/shutdown 
  seems the best option. Lost data in this table is not *that* important, combined with a 24hour save, we're good.
  
- Clean. Up. Code.
